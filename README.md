## 📚 About

<strong> Landing Page</strong> is a page that has all the elements aimed at converting the visitor into Lead, opportunity or customer. Also as landing pages or conversion pages, Landing Pages are widely used in Digital Marketing campaigns, as they tend to have high conversion rates.

## 🛠 Design pattern

<p align="justify">
<a href="https://github.com/ttoss/monorepo"><strong> Monorepo </strong></a> (ttoss Monorepo Template) as the name says, would be a single repository to keep the code of several projects. Each app domain is within this repository: backend, IoT, machine learning, web and mobile apps. This repository structure is useful because we can access any part of the application without changing the repository.
